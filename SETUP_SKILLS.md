# Setting up Skills in Supabase

To set up the skills management system:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `app/api/skills/setup-database.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will:
1. Create the required tables (`skill_categories`, `skills`, `soft_skills`)
2. Set up appropriate permissions
3. Add sample data to get you started

After running the script, the skills section of your portfolio will be populated with the sample data.
